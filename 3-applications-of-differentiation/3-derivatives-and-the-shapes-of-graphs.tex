\subsection{Derivatives and the Shapes of Graphs}

\subsubsection*{First Derivatives}
Increasing/Decreasing Test:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(f'(x)>0\) on an interval, then \(f\) is increasing on that
    interval.
    \item If \(f'(x)<0\) on an interval, then \(f\) is decreasing on that
    interval.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) be any two numbers in the interval with
    \(x_1<x_2\).
    Given \(f'(x)>0\), we know that \(f\) is differentiable on \([x_1,x_2]\).
    By Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem, there is a number \(c\) between \(x_1\)
    and \(x_2\) such that
    \[f(x_2)-f(x_1)=f'(c)(x_2-x_1)\]
    Since \(f'(c)>0\) and \(x_2-x_1>0\), thus
    \[f(x_2)-f(x_1)>0\]
    or
    \[f(x_1)<f(x_2)\]
    This shows that \(f\) is increasing.
    Part 2 is proved similarly.
\end{proof}
The First Derivative Test: Suppose that \(c\) is a critical number of a
continuous function \(f\).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(f'\) changes from positive to negative at \(c\), then \(f\) has
    a local maximum at \(c\).
    \item If \(f'\) changes from negative to positive at \(c\), then \(f\) has
    a local minimum at \(c\).
    \item If \(f'\) does not change sign at \(c\), then \(f\) has no local
    maximum or minimum at \(c\).
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection*{Second Derivatives}
\begin{definition}
    If the graph of \(f\) lies above all of its tangents on an interval \(I\),
    then it is called \textbf{concave upward} on \(I\).
    If the graph of \(f\) lies below all of its tangents on \(I\), it is
    called \textbf{concave downward} on \(I\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A point \(P\) on a curve \(y=f(x)\) is called an \textbf{inflection point}
    if \(f\) is continuous there and the curve changes from concave upward to
    downward or from concave downward to concave upward at \(P\).
\end{definition}
Concavity Test:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(f''(x)>0\) for all \(x\) in \(I\), then the graph of \(f\) is
    concave upward on \(I\).
    \item If \(f''(x)<0\) for all \(x\) in \(I\), then the graph of \(f\) is
    concave downward on \(I\).
\end{enumerate}
The Second Derivative Test: Suppose \(f''\) is continuous near \(c\).
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(f'(c)=0\) and \(f''(c)>0\), then \(f\) has a local minimum at
    \(c\).
    \item If \(f'(c)=0\) and \(f''(c)<0\), then \(f\) has a local maximum at
    \(c\).
\end{enumerate}
