\subsection{Derivatives and the Shapes of Graphs}

Increasing/Decreasing Test:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item If \(f'(x)>0\) on an interval, then \(f\) is increasing on that
    interval.
    \item If \(f'(x)<0\) on an interval, then \(f\) is decreasing on that
    interval.
\end{enumerate}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(x_1\) and \(x_2\) be any two numbers in the interval with
    \(x_1<x_2\).
    Given \(f'(x)>0\), we know that \(f\) is differentiable on \([x_1,x_2]\).
    By Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem, there is a number \(c\) between \(x_1\)
    and \(x_2\) such that
    \[f(x_2)-f(x_1)=f'(c)(x_2-x_1)\]
    Since \(f'(c)>0\) and \(x_2-x_1>0\), thus
    \[f(x_2)-f(x_1)>0\]
    or
    \[f(x_1)<f(x_2)\]
    This shows that \(f\) is increasing.
    Part 2 is proved similarly.
\end{proof}
