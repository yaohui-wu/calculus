\subsection{Optimization Problems}

\begin{problem}
    A farmer has 2400 m of fencing and wants to fence off a rectangular field
    that borders a straight river.
    He needs no fence along the river.
    What are the dimensions of the field that has the largest area?
\end{problem}
\begin{solution}
    We want to maximize the area \(A\) of the rectangle.
    Let \(x\) and \(y\) be the length and width of the rectangle.
    Then the area is
    \[A=xy\]
    Given that the total length of fencing is 2400 m so
    \[x+2y=2400\]
    Thus
    \[y=1200-\frac{1}{2}x\]
    and so
    \[A=x\left(1200-\frac{1}{2}x\right)=1200x-\frac{1}{2}x^2\]
    Note that \(x\geq 0\) and \(x\leq 2400\).
    So the function we want to maximize is
    \[A(x)=1200x-\frac{1}{2}x^2,\quad 0\leq x\leq 2400\]
    The derivative is \(A'(x)=1200-x\), so to find the critical numbers we solve
    the equation
    \[1200-x=0\]
    which gives \(x=1200\).
    Since \(A(0)=0,A(1200)=720000,A(2400)=0\), the Closed Interval Method
    gives the maximum value as \(A(1200)=720000\).
    Thus the rectangular field should have a length of 1,200 m and a width of
    600 m.
