\subsection{Polar Coordinates}

We choose a point \(O\) in the plane called the \textbf{pole} (or origin).
Then we draw a ray (half-line) starting at \(O\) called the
\textbf{polar axis}.
This axis is usually drawn horizontally to the right and
corresponds to the positive \(x\)-axis in Cartesian coordinates.
If \(P\) is any other point in the plane, let \(r\) be the distance from \(O\)
to \(P\) and let \(\theta\) be the angle between the polar axis and line \(OP\).
Then the point \(P\) is represented by the ordered pair \((r,\theta)\) called
the polar coordinates of \(P\).
We use the convention that an angle is positive if measured in the
counterclockwise direction from the polar axis and negative in the clockwise
direction.
If \(P=O\), then \(r=0\) and we agree that \((0,\theta)\) represents the pole
for any value of \(\theta\).
We extend the meaning of polar coordinates \((r,\theta)\) to the case \(r\) is
negative by agreeing that, the points \((-r,\theta)\) and \((r,\theta)\) lie
on the same line through \(O\) and at the same distance \(|r|\) from \(O\),
but on opposite sides of \(O\).
If \(r>0\), the point \((r,\theta)\) lies in the same quadrant as \(\theta\);
if \(r<0\), it lies in the quadrant on the opposite side of the pole.
Note that \((-r,\theta)\) represents the same point as \((r,\theta+\pi)\).
Suppose that point \(P\) has Cartesian coordinates \((x,y)\) and polar
coordinates \((r,\theta)\).
To find Cartesian coordinates \((x,y)\) when polar coordinates \((r,\theta)\)
are known, we use the equations
\begin{align*}
    x &= r\cos\theta & y &= r\sin\theta
\end{align*}
To find polar coordinates \((x,y)\) when Cartesian coordinates \((r,\theta)\)
are known, we use the equations
\begin{align*}
    r^2 &= x^2+y^2 & \tan\theta &= \frac{y}{x}
\end{align*}

\subsubsection*{Polar Curves}
The graph of a polar equation \(r=f(\theta)\), or more generally
\(F(r,\theta)=0\), consists of all points \(P\) that have at least one polar
representation \((r,\theta)\) whose coordinates satisfy the equation.
