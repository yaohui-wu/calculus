\subsection{Parametric Equations}

Suppose that \(x\) and \(y\) are both given as functions of the variable
\(t\), the \textbf{parameter}, by the equations
\begin{align*}
    x &= f(t) & y &= g(t)
\end{align*}
which are the \textbf{parametric equations}.
As \(t\) varies, the point \((x,y)=(f(t),g(t))\) varies and traces out a curve
which is the parametric curve.
In general, the curve with parametric equations
\begin{align*}
    x &= f(t) & y &= g(t) & a\leq t\leq b
\end{align*}
has \textbf{initial point} \((f(a),g(a))\) and \textbf{terminal point}
\((f(b),g(b))\).
