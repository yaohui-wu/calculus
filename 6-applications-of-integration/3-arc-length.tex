\subsection{Arc Length}

Suppose that a curve \(C\) is defined by the equation \(y=f(x)\), where \(f\)
is continuous and \(a\leq x\leq b\).
We define the \textbf{length} \(L\) of the curve \(C\) with equation
\(y=f(x),a\leq x\leq b\), as the limit of the lengths of the inscribed
polygons (if the limit exists):
\[L=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n |P_{i-1}P_i|\]
We can derive an integral formula for \(L\) in the case where \(f\) has a
continuous derivative.
Such a function \(f\) is called \textbf{smooth} because a small change in
\(x\) produces a small change in \(f'(x)\).
\[L=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\sqrt{1+\big[f'(x_i^*)\big]^2}\Delta x\]
The \textbf{Arc Length Formula}: If \(f'\) is continuous on \([a,b]\), then
the length of the curve \(y=f(x),a\leq x\leq b\), is
\[L=\int_a^b\sqrt{1+\big[f'(x)\big]^2}\,dx\]
In Leibniz's notation:
\[L=\int_a^b\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}\,dx\]
If a curve has the equation \(x=g(y),c\leq y\leq d\), and \(g'(y)\) is
continuous, then the Arc Length Formula is:
\[L=\int_c^d\sqrt{1+\big[g'(y)\big]^2}\,dy
=\int_c^d\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dx}{dy}\right)^2}\,dy\]

\subsubsection*{The Arc Length Function}
If a smooth curve \(C\) has the equation \(y=f(x),a\leq x\leq b\), let
\(s(x)\) be the distance along \(C\) from the initial starting point
\(P_0(a,f(a))\) to the point \(Q(x,f(x))\).
Then \(s\) is a function, called the \textbf{arc length function}, and
\[s(x)=\int_a^x\sqrt{1+\big[f'(t)\big]^2}\,dt\]
By the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus,
\[\frac{ds}{dx}=\sqrt{1+\big[f'(x)\big]^2}
=\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}\]
The differential of arc length is
\[ds=\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dy}{dx}\right)^2}\,dx\]
and this equation is sometimes written in the symmetric form
\[(ds)^2=(dx)^2+(dy)^2\]
If we write \(\displaystyle{L=\int ds}\), then we can solve to get
\[ds=\sqrt{1+\left(\frac{dx}{dy}\right)^2}\,dy\]
