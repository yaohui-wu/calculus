\subsection{Areas between Curves}

Consider the region \(S\) that lies between two curves \(y=f(x)\) and
\(y=g(x)\) and between the vertical lines \(x=a\) and \(x=b\), where \(f\)
and \(g\) are continuous functions and \(f(x)\geq g(x)\) for all \(x\) in
\([a,b]\).
We define the \textbf{area} \(A\) of \(S\) as as the limiting value of the sum
of the areas of the approximating rectangles.
\[A=\lim_{n\to\infty}\sum_{i=1}^n\big[f(x_i^*)-g(x_i^*)\big]\Delta x\]
The area \(A\) of the region bounded by the curves \(y=f(x),y=g(x)\) and the
lines \(x=a,x=b\), where \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous and \(f(x)\geq g(x)\)
for all \(x\) in \([a,b]\), is
\[A=\int_a^b \big[f(x)-g(x)\big]\,dx\]
If a region is bounded by curves with equations \(x=f(y),x=g(y),y=c,y=d\),
where \(f\) and \(g\) are continuous and \(f(y)\geq g(y)\) for
\(c\leq y\leq d\), then its area is
\[A=\int_c^d \big[f(y)-g(y)\big]\,dy\]
