\subsection{Direction Fields and Euler's Method}

\subsubsection*{Direction Fields}
Suppose we are given a first order differential equation of the form \(y'=F(x,y)\).
If a solution curve, or an integral curve, passes through the point
\((x_0,y_0)\), then its slope at the point is \(y'(x_0)=F(x_0,y_0)\).
If we draw short line segments with slopes \(F(x,y)\) at serval points
\((x,y)\), then the result is a \textbf{direction field}, or a
\textbf{slope field}.
