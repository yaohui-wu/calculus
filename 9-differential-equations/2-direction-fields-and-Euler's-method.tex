\subsection{Direction Fields and Euler's Method}

\subsubsection*{Direction Fields}

Suppose we are given a first order differential equation of the form
\[y'=F(x,y)\]
where \(F(x,y)\) is some expression in \(x\) and \(y\).
Note that a separable equation is the special case in which can be factored as
a function of \(x\) times a function of \(y\).
If a solution curve passes through a point \((x,y)\), then its slope at the
point is \(y'\), which is equal to \(F(x,y)\).
If we draw short line segments with slopes \(F(x,y)\) at serval points
\((x,y)\), then the result is a \textbf{direction field} (or a
\textbf{slope field}).
