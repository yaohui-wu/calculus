\subsection{Derivatives and Rates of Change}

\subsubsection*{Tangents}
\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{tangent line} of the curve \(y=f(x)\) at the point
    \(P(a, f(a))\) is the line through \(P\) with slope
    \[m=\lim_{x\to a}\frac{f(x)-f(a)}{x-a}\]
    provided that this limit exists.
\end{definition}
If \(h=x-a\), then the slope of the tangent line is
\[m=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\]

\subsubsection*{Velocities}
\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{instantaneous velocity} of an object with position function
    \(f(t)\) at time \(t=a\) is
    \[v(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\]
    provided that this limit exists.
\end{definition}

\subsubsection*{Derivatives}
\begin{definition}
    The \textbf{derivative of a function \(f\) at a number \(a\)} is
    \[f'(a)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{f(a+h)-f(a)}{h}\]
    if this limit exists.
\end{definition}
The tangent line to \(y=f(x)\) at the point \((a,f(a))\) is the line through
\((a,f(a))\) whose slope is equal to \(f'(a)\),
the derivative of \(f\) at \(a\).
The equation of the tangent line to the curve \(y=f(x)\) at the point
\((a,f(a))\) in point-slope form is
\[y-f(a)=f'(a)(x-a)\]

\subsubsection*{Rates of Change}
The instantaneous rate of change of \(y=f(x)\) with respect to \(x\) at
\(x=x_0\) in the interval \([x_0,x_1]\) is
\[\lim_{\Delta x\to 0}\frac{\Delta y}{\Delta x}
=\lim_{x_1 \to x_0}\frac{f(x_1)-f(x_0)}{x_1-x_0}\]
The derivative \(f'(a)\) is the instantaneous rate of change of \(y=f(x)\)
with respect to \(x\) when \(x=a\).
If \(s=f(t)\) is a position function of an object, then the velocity of the
object at time \(t=a\) is \(v(a)=f'(a)\) and the speed of the object is
\(|f'(a)|\), the magnitude of the velocity.
