\subsection{Power Series}

A \textbf{power series} is a series of the form
\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n x^n=c_0+c_1 x +c_2 x^2+c_3 x^3+\cdots\]

A power series is a series in which each term is a power function.
A \textbf{trigonometric series}
\[\sum_{n=0}^\infty(a_n\cos nx+b_n\sin nx)\]
is a series whose terms are trigonometric functions.

In general, a power series centered at \(a\) is a series of the form
\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n(x-a)^n=a_0+c_1(x-a)+c_2(x-a)^2+\cdots\]
where \(x\) is a variable and the coefficient \(c_n\) is a constant.
The sum of the series is a function
\[f(x)=c_0+c_1x+c_2x^2+\cdots+c_nx^n+\cdots\]
whose domain is the set of all \(x\) for which the series converges.
\begin{theorem}
    For a given power series
    \(\displaystyle{\sum_{n=0}^\infty c_n(x-a)^n}\) there are only three
    possibilities:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The series converges only when \(x=a\).
        \item The series converges for all \(x\in\R\).
        \item There is a positive number \(R\) such that the series converges
        if \(|x-a|<R\) and diverges if \(|x-a|>R\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
The number \(R\) in cases 3 is the \textbf{radius of convergence} of the power
series.
The radius of convergence is \(R=0\) in case 1 and \(R=\infty\) in case 2.
The \textbf{interval of convergence} of a power series is the interval that
consists of all values of \(x\) for which the series converges.
