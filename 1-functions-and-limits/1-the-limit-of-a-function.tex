\subsection{The Limit of a Function}

\subsubsection*{Functions}
\begin{definition}
    A \textbf{function} \(f\) is a rule that assigns to each element \(x\) in
    a set \(D\) exactly one element \(f(x)\) in a set \(E\).
\end{definition}
We usually consider functions for which the sets \(D\) and \(E\) are sets of
real numbers.
The set \(D\) is called the \textbf{domain} of the function.
The \textbf{range} of \(f\) is the set of all possible values of \(f(x)\) as
\(x\) varies throughout the domain.
A symbol that represents an arbitrary number in the domain of a function \(f\)
is called an \textbf{independent variable}.
A symbol that represents a number in the range of \(f\) is called a
\textbf{dependent variable}.

If \(f\) is a function with domain \(D\), then its \textbf{graph} is the set
of ordered pairs
\[\{(x,f(x))\mid x\in D\}\]
The graph of \(f\) consists of all points \((x,y)\) in the coordinate plane
such that \(y=f(x)\) and \(x\) is in the domain of \(f\).

\subsubsection*{Symmetry}
If a function \(f\) satisfies \(f(-x)=f(x)\) for every number \(x\) in its
domain, then \(f\) is called an \textbf{even function}.

If \(f\) satisfies \(f(-x)=-f(x)\) for every number \(x\) in its
domain, then \(f\) is called an \textbf{odd function}.

\subsubsection*{Increasing and Decreasing Functions}
A function \(f\) is called \textbf{increasing} on an interval \(I\) if
\[f(x_1)<f(x_2)\]
whenever \(x_1<x_2\) in \(I\).
It is called \textbf{decreasing} on \(I\) if
\[f(x_1)>f(x_2)\]
whenever \(x_1<x_2\) in \(I\).

\subsubsection*{Inverse Functions}
\begin{definition}
    A function \(f\) is \textbf{injective} (or \textbf{one-to-one}) if
    \[f(x_1)\neq f(x_2)\]
    whenever \(x_1\neq x_2\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A function \(f\) is \textbf{surjective} (or \textbf{onto}) if for all
    \(y\) in range \(Y\),
    there exists an \(x\) in domain \(X\) such that \(f(x)=y\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    A function \(f\) is \textbf{bijective} if \(f\) is injective and
    surjective (or one-to-one and onto).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    Let \(f\) be a one-to-one function with domain \(A\) and range \(B\).
    Then its \textbf{inverse function} \(f^{-1}\) has domain \(B\) and range
    \(A\) and is defined by
    \[f^{-1}(y)=x\iff f(x)=y\]
    for all \(y\) in \(B\).
\end{definition}
The letter \(x\) is traditionally used as the independent variable, so when we
concentrate on \(f^{-1}\) rather than on \(f\), we usually reverse the roles
of \(x\) and \(y\) and write
\[f^{-1}(x)=y\iff f(y)=x\]
We have the following \textbf{ cancellation equations}:
\[f^{-1}(f(x))=x\]
for every \(x\) in \(A\) and
\[f(f^{-1}(x))=x\]
for every \(x\) in \(B\). \\
Find the Inverse of a One-to-One Function \(f\):
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Write \(y=f(x)\).
    \item Solve this equation for \(x\) in terms of \(y\) (if possible).
    \item To express \(f^{-1}\) as a function of \(x\), interchange \(x\) and
    \(y\).
    The resulting equation is \(y=f^{-1}(x)\).
\end{enumerate}
The graph of \(f^{-1}\) is obtained by reflecting the graph of \(f\) about the
line \(y=x\).

\subsubsection*{Mathematical Modeling}
A mathematical model is a mathematical description (often by means of a
function or an equation) of a real-world phenomenon.
The purpose of the model is to understand the phenomenon and perhaps
to make predictions about future behavior.

A mathematical model is never a completely accurate representation of a
physical situation, it is an idealization.

\subsubsection*{Intuitive Definition of a Limit}
Suppose \(f(x)\) is defined near the number \(a\).
(This means that \(f(x)\) is defined on some open interval that contains the
number \(a\),
except possibly at \(a\) itself.)
\begin{definition}
    We write
    \[\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L\]
    and say that the \textbf{limit} of \(f(x)\),
    as \(x\) approaches \(a\),
    equals \(L\),
    if we can make the values of \(f(x)\) arbitrarily close to \(L\) by taking
    \(x\) to be sufficiently close to \(a\) but \(x\neq a\).
\end{definition}
An alternative notation for the limit is \(f(x)\to L\) as \(x\to a\).

\subsubsection*{One-Sided Limits}
\begin{definition}
    We write
    \[\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)=L\]
    and say that the \textbf{left-hand limit} of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches
    \(a\) is equal to \(L\) if we can make the values of \(f(x)\) arbitrarily
    close to \(L\) by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(a\) and \(x<a\).
\end{definition}
\begin{definition}
    We write
    \[\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)=L\]
    and say that the \textbf{right-hand limit} of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches
    \(a\) is equal to \(L\) if we can make the values of \(f(x)\) arbitrarily
    close to \(L\) by taking \(x\) sufficiently close to \(a\) and \(x>a\).
\end{definition}
\begin{theorem}
    \(\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to a}f(x)=L}\) if and only if
    \(\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to a^-}f(x)}=L\) and
    \(\displaystyle{\lim_{x\to a^+}f(x)}=L\).
\end{theorem}
The limit exists if and only if the left-hand limit and the right-hand limit
of \(f(x)\) as \(x\) approaches \(a\) are equal to \(L\),
otherwise the limit does not exist.
