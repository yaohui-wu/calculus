\subsection{The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}

\begin{theorem}[The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]
    Suppose \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b]\).
    If the function \(F\) is defined by
    \[F(x)=\int_a^xf(t)\,dt,\quad a\leq x\leq b\]
    then \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\) and \[F'(x)=f(x),\quad a<x<b\]
    and therefore\[\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)\,dt=f(x)\]
    If \(F\) is an antiderivative of \(f\) such that \(F'=f\), then
    \[\int_a^b f(x)\,dx=F(b)-F(a)\]
\end{theorem}
