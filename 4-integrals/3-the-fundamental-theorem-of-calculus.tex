\subsection{The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus}

The \textbf{Fundamental Theorem of Calculus} establishes a connection between the two \\
branches of calculus: differential calculus and integral calculus.
It says that differentiation and integration are inverse processes and gives
the precise inverse relationship between the derivative and the integral.
\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1]
    If \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b]\), then the function \(g\) defined by
    \[g(x)=\int_a^x f(t)\,dt,\quad a\leq x\leq b\]
    is an antiderivative of \(f\), that is, \(g'(x)=f(x)\) for \(a<x<b\).
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    If \(x\) and \(x+h\) are in the open interval \((a,b)\), then
    \begin{align*}
        g(x+h)-g(x) &= \int_a^{x+h}f(t)\,dt-\int_a^x f(t)\,dt \\
        &= \left(\int_a^x f(t)\,dt+\int_x^{x+h}f(t)\,dt\right)
        -\int_a^x f(t)\,dt \\
        &= \int_x^{x+h}f(t)\,dt
    \end{align*}
    and so, for \(h\neq 0\),
    \[\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}=\frac{1}{h}\int_x^{x+h}f(t)\,dt\]
    Assume that \(h>0\).
    Since \(f\) is continuous on \([x,x+h]\), the Extreme Value Theorem says
    that there are numbers \(u\) and \(v\) in \([x,x+h]\) such that \(f(u)=m\)
    and \(f(v)=M\), where \(m\) and \(M\) are the absolute minimum and the
    absolute maximum values of \(f\) in \([x,x+h]\).
    Then
    \[m\cdot h\leq\int_x^{x+h}f(t)\,dt\leq M\cdot h\]
    that is,
    \[f(u)\cdot h\leq\int_x^{x+h}f(t)\,dt\leq f(v)\cdot h\]
    Since \(h>0\), we have
    \[f(u)\leq\frac{1}{h}\int_x^{x+h}f(t)\,dt\leq f(v)\]
    Thus
    \[f(u)\leq\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}\leq f(v)\]
    This inequality can be proved in a similar manner for the case \(h<0\).
    Let \(h\to 0\).
    Then \(u\to x\) and \(v\to x\), since \(u\) and \(v\) lie between \(x\)
    and \(x+h\).
    Thus
    \[\lim_{h\to 0}f(u)=\lim_{u\to x}f(u)=f(x)\]
    and
    \[\lim_{h\to 0}f(v)=\lim_{v\to x}f(v)=f(x)\]
    because \(f\) is continuous at \(x\).
    By the Squeeze Theorem,
    \[g'(x)=\lim_{h\to 0}\frac{g(x+h)-g(x)}{h}=f(x)\]
    If \(x=a\) or \(b\), then we can interpret this equation as a one-sided
    limit.
    Since \(g\) is differentiable, this shows that  \(g\) is continuous on
    \([a,b]\).
\end{proof}
Using Leibniz notation for derivatives, we can write the Fundamental Theorem
of Calculus Part 1 as
\[\frac{d}{dx}\int_a^x f(t)\,dt=f(x)\]

\subsubsection*{Differentiation and Integration as Inverse Processes}
\begin{theorem}[Fundamental Theorem of Calculus]
    Suppose \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b]\).
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item If
        \[g(x)=\int_a^x f(t)\,dt\]
        then
        \[g'(x)=f(x)\]
        \item
        \[\int_a^b f(x)\,dx=F(b)-F(a)\]
        where \(F\) is any antiderivative of \(f\), that is, \(F'=f\).
    \end{enumerate}
\end{theorem}
The Fundamental Theorem of Calculus is the most important theorem in calculus.
It is one of the greatest accomplishments of the human mind.

\subsubsection*{Average Value of a Function}
We define the \textbf{average value of} \(f\) on the interval \([a,b]\) as
\[\overline{f}=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)\,dx\]\
\begin{theorem}[Mean Value Theorem for Integrals]
    If \(f\) is continuous on \([a,b]\), then there exists a number \(c\) in
    \([a,b]\) such that
    \[f(c)=\overline{f}=\frac{1}{b-a}\int_a^b f(x)\,dx\]
    that is,
    \[\int_a^b f(x)\,dx=f(c)(b-a)\]
\end{theorem}
\begin{proof}
    Let \(\displaystyle{F(x)=\int_a^x f(t)\,dt}\) for \\
    \(a\leq x\leq b\).
    By Lagrange's Mean Value Theorem for derivatives, there is a number \(c\)
    between \(a\) and \(b\) such that
    \[F(b)-F(a)=F'(c)(b-a)\]
    But \(F'(x)=f(x)\) by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus Part 1.
    Therefore
    \[\int_a^b f(t)\,dt-0=f(c)(b-a)\]
\end{proof}
