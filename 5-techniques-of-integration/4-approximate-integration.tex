\subsection{Approximate Integration}

Most of the functions we study here in calculus are
\textbf{elementary functions}.
These are the polynomials, rational functions, power functions, exponential
functions, logarithmic functions, trigonometric and inverse trigonometric
functions, and all functions that can be obtained from these by the five
operations of addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and
composition.
If \(f\) is an elementary function, then \(f'\) is an elementary function but
\(\displaystyle{\int f(x)\,dx}\) need not be an elementary function.
Consider \(f(x)=e^{x^2}\).
Since \(f\) is continuous, its integral exists, and if we define the function
\(F\) by
\[F(x)=\int_0^x e^{t^2}\,dt\]
that we know that by the Fundamental Theorem of Calculus that
\[F'(x)=e^{x^2}\]
Thus \(f(x)=e^{x^2}\) has an antiderivative \(F\), but it can be proved that
\(F\) is not an elementary function.
This means that we cannot evaluate \(\displaystyle{\int e^{x^2}\,dx}\) in
terms of elementary functions.
The same can be said of the following integrals:
\begin{align*}
    & \int\frac{e^x}{x}\,dx && \int\sin(x^2)\,dx & \int\cos(e^x)\,dx \\
    & \int\sqrt{x^3+1}\,dx && \int\frac{1}{\ln x}\,dx & \int\frac{\sin x}{x}\,dx
\end{align*}
In fact, the majority of elementary functions do not have elementary
antiderivatives. \\
Trapezoidal Rule:
\[\int_a^b f(x)\,dx\approx T_n
=\frac{\Delta x}{2}\big[f(x_0)+2f(x_1)+f(x_2)+\cdots+2f(x_{n-1})+f(x_n)\big]\]
where \(\Delta x=\dfrac{b-a}{n}\) and \(x_i=a+i\Delta x\). \\
Error Bounds: Suppose \(|f''(x)|\leq K\) for \(a\leq x\leq b\).
If \(E_T\) and \(E_M\) are the errors in the Trapezoidal and Midpoint Rules,
then
\[|E_T|\leq\frac{K(b-a)^3}{12n^2}\]
and
\[|E_M|\leq\frac{K(b-a)^3}{24n^2}\]

\subsubsection*{Simpson's Rule}
Simpson's Rule:
\[\int_a^b f(x)\,dx\approx S_n
=\frac{\Delta x}{3}\big[f(x_0)+4f(x_1)+2f(x)2+4f(x_3)+\cdots+2f(x_{n-2})
+4f(x_{n-1})+f(x_n)\big]\]
where \(n\) is even and \(\Delta x=\dfrac{b-a}{n}\). \\
Error Bounds for Simpson's Rule: Suppose \(|f^{(4)}(x)|\leq K\) for
\(a\leq x\leq b\).
If \(E_S\) is the error involved in using Simpson's Rule, then
\[|E_S|\leq\frac{K(b-a)^5}{180n^4}\]
